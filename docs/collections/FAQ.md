### Arrays vs Collection

#### Arrays 

- fixed size 
- hold only homogeneous data types elements
- simple constructs with linear storage
- hold both object and primitive
-  no underlying data structures
   >  array itself used as data structure

#### Collection

- resizable, increase or decrease
- hold both homogeneous and and heterogeneous elements
- different internal storage structure
  > linear, list, hash set, tree, etc
- hold only object types but primitive
- implemented based on some std data structure
